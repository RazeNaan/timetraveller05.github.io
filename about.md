**Hola Lectores!**

So here I introduce me and my blog. 

I am Anubhav Mishra, currently a student of International Institute of Information Technology Bangalore. I am pursuing my integrated Masters of technology degree in Electronics and Communication Engineering here.

New to the field of computer science, I am fascinated by the wonders a few lines of code can create. I would like to get involved in this amazing sorcery and contribute to the development of this field.

I intend to account all the advancements I make in my field of interest in this blog. 

Hope you enjoy it!
